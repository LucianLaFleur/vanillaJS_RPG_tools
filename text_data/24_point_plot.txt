`1) Really Bad Day (the normalcy for this world and the character’s place in it are established) -  ` 
`2) Strange Thing Breaks The Mold (something upsets the usual pace of things, and we see how the world reacts) ` 
`3) escalating upset leads to an opportunity (the hero actively reacts to the change in pace and makes an active decision)` 
`4) Call to Adventure (Key figures / info about new world exposed)` 
`5) Out of depth moment (show progress with new world, but struggle with main theme)` 
`6) Antagonist’s Opening Gambit (just as the heroes are making progress, an opposing force ups the ante and reveals things are much tougher than before)` 
`7) Gathering power (usually, reach out to allies, avoid enemies.)`

`14) revised plans (preparing to carry out the results of the evaluation, secondary characters react to decision)` 
`15) In insightful glimpse (an important advancement towards the hero’s new desire is made, giving a glimpse of either hope or despair as the hero is rooted in, or disillusioned from, their new plans. *Climax of B-plot)` 
`16) direct action - the most logical, straightforward solutions to the antagonistic problem are attempted.` 
`17) antagonist’s counter - the villain reveals they are competent by thwarting the direct solution with a counter-play (might be foreshadowed before, but ignored because the main character doesn’t have influence).` 
`18) key revelation - (an important element is found, which can turn the tide of the central conflict *Resolves B-plot)` 
`19) severe setback pushes to the breaking point (the heroes are almost entirely defeated and face the edge of ultimate defeat)` 
`20) pep-talk/intervention helps to give hope (a risky idea offers some small chance of success)` 
`21) Calvary ride (a fearless charge towards the risk, wholeheartedly)` 
`22) The tower falls (ultimate devastation falls all around the heroes, and it appears that all is lost)` 
`23) Heroic moment (an epic feat allows for the hero to overcome even the worst of circumstances and defeat the ultimate evil)`
